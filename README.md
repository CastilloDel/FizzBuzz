## FizzBuzz in several languages

Each language has a different implementation

### Java

The Java implementation is a stateful class with only one public method that iterates infinitely.

### Haskell

The Haskell implementation is a stateless function (functional programming yay!) that takes a number and return the "fizzbuzz equivalent" version.
